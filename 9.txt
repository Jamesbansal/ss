9. a) Write a $hell script that accepts two file names as arguments, checks if the permissions for both the files are
identical and if the permissions are identical, outputs the common permissions; otherwise outputs each file name
followed by its permissions.
if [ $# != 2 ]
then
echo "Invalid input!!!"
else
p1=`ls -l $1|cut -d " " -f1`
p2=`ls -l $2|cut -d " " -f1`
if [ $p1 == $p2 ]
then
echo "the file permissions are same and it is : "
echo "$p1"
else
echo "The file permissions are different"
echo "$1 : $p1"
echo "$2 : $p2"
fi
fi
Command for execution: 
Sh 9a.sh filename1 filename2





b) Write a C program that creates a child process to read commands from the standard input and execute them
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int ch,rv;
char cmd[10];
rv=fork();
if(rv==0)
{
do
{
printf("\nEnter a command\n");
scanf("%s",cmd);
system(cmd);
printf("\n1 : continue\n0 : exit\n");
scanf("%d",&ch);
}
while(ch!=0);
}
else
{
wait(0);
printf("\nChild terminated\n");
}
return 0;
}
Command for execution: 
cc pgm_name.c
./a.out
